# Product Requirements Document: Linux ARM64 Support for Tokenizers

## Project Overview
Add Linux ARM64 architecture support to the @accessprotocol/tokenizers package by creating a new subpackage `tokenizers-linux-arm64-gnu` that compiles the Rust tokenizers library for Linux ARM64 systems.

## Background
The current tokenizers project supports:
- Windows x64 (win32-x64-msvc)
- Linux x64 (linux-x64-gnu) 
- macOS Universal (darwin-universal)

With the growing adoption of ARM64 Linux systems (servers, edge devices, Raspberry Pi, Apple Silicon running Linux), there is a need to support this architecture.

## Objectives
1. Enable compilation of the tokenizers Rust library for Linux ARM64 architecture
2. Create a new npm subpackage `@accessprotocol/tokenizers-linux-arm64-gnu`
3. Integrate ARM64 build into the existing CI/CD pipeline
4. Ensure full feature parity with existing architectures
5. Maintain backward compatibility with existing packages

## Success Criteria
- Linux ARM64 users can install and use the tokenizers package
- ARM64 builds pass all existing tests
- Build artifacts are properly generated and published
- Documentation includes ARM64 installation instructions
- CI/CD pipeline automatically builds and tests ARM64 binaries

## Technical Requirements

### Build System Updates
- Update Cargo.toml to support aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu target
- Configure napi-rs build system for ARM64 compilation
- Update package.json napi triples configuration
- Ensure cross-compilation works from x64 systems

### Package Structure
- Create npm/linux-arm64-gnu/ directory structure
- Generate appropriate package.json for ARM64 subpackage
- Follow existing naming conventions and structure
- Include proper OS/CPU/libc specifications

### Cross-Compilation Setup
- Configure Rust toolchain for aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu
- Set up linker and build dependencies for ARM64
- Handle any platform-specific compilation flags
- Ensure reproducible builds across different host systems

### CI/CD Integration
- Add ARM64 build jobs to existing workflow
- Configure artifact generation for ARM64 binaries
- Set up testing on ARM64 systems (emulation or native)
- Integrate with existing release and publishing pipeline

### Testing & Validation
- Verify all tokenizer functionality works on ARM64
- Run existing test suite on ARM64 architecture
- Performance benchmarking compared to x64 builds
- Memory usage and compatibility testing

### Documentation
- Update README with ARM64 installation instructions
- Document build requirements for ARM64 development
- Include troubleshooting guide for ARM64-specific issues
- Update architecture support matrix

## Technical Constraints
- Must maintain compatibility with Node.js >= 10
- Follow existing code patterns and project structure
- Use same dependency versions as other architectures
- Ensure minimal performance overhead
- Support glibc-based Linux distributions

## Dependencies
- Rust toolchain with aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu target
- Cross-compilation tools and linkers
- ARM64 testing environment (emulated or native)
- Updated CI/CD infrastructure

## Deliverables
1. Updated build configuration files
2. New linux-arm64-gnu subpackage structure
3. Cross-compilation setup and documentation
4. Updated CI/CD pipeline with ARM64 builds
5. Comprehensive testing suite for ARM64
6. Updated project documentation
7. Published ARM64 npm package

## Timeline
- Phase 1: Build system configuration and local compilation (Week 1)
- Phase 2: Package structure and npm integration (Week 1)
- Phase 3: CI/CD pipeline integration (Week 2)
- Phase 4: Testing and validation (Week 2)
- Phase 5: Documentation and release (Week 3)

## Risk Mitigation
- Test cross-compilation extensively before CI integration
- Validate on multiple ARM64 Linux distributions
- Ensure fallback mechanisms for unsupported systems
- Monitor performance implications of ARM64 builds
- Plan rollback strategy if issues arise post-release
